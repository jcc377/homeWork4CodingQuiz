# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

This application was supposed to be a three question quiz I designed regarding the topic of ancient Helenic History. I was able to set up some good logic loops but I failed ultimately. My strategy was as follows: when the start button is clicked, the timer starts, and the first question appears, IF the first question is answered correctly, THEN the first question disappears and the second first appears, this cycle would repeat for the second and third questions. The game would end upon the timer running out. Also, I desired to tally the # of correct answers obtained by a user. I failed to make the questions appear/disappear, and thus tally the score as well since I couldn't make the questions load in the web browser. I apologize - I gave roughly 30 hours of effort on this assignment with help from my tutor but could not figure out the appear/disappear portion of my strategy.
